Description
-------------

> Given an array "nums" of integers and an int "k", Partition the array (i.e move the elements in "nums") such that,
> 
> + All elements < k are moved to the left
> + All elements >= k are moved to the right
> 
> Return the partitioning Index, i.e the first index "i" nums[i] >= k.
> 
> Note
> 
> You should do really partition in array "nums" instead of just counting the numbers of integers smaller than k.
> 
> If all elements in "nums" are larger than k, then return "nums.length"
> 
> Example
> 
> If nums = `[3,2,2,1]` and k=`2`, a valid answer is `1`.
